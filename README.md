# update scripts

## install-multimc.sh
a shell script that will install multimc development edition into /usr/share

## update-insiders.sh
a shell script that will install/update vscode insiders into /usr/share

### Running
The script automatically assumes you have `tar` and `wget`. 
Just run `./update-insiders.sh` or `./install-multimc`, using `chmod +x <script>.sh` if needed.
Also, make sure to have your password ready, because this script uses `sudo`.
Other than that, this is intended for x86_64 (64 bit) linux systems only. It should work on any distribution regardless.
Sometimes the best projects are the simplest ones ;)
Have fun!
